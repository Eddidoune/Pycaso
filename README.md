# Pycaso
PYthon module for CAlibration of cameras by SOloffâ€™s method

Pycaso is a python code used to calibrate any camera using the method o Soloff. This method links detected points X from cameras left an right to the real position x in the 3D-space. It is divided in two parts :
- Calibration : A lot of coordinates (X=(X,Y) and x(x,y,z)) are known and a polynomial form P can be estimate for each coordinate X = P(x)
- Identification : With a Levenberg-Marcquardt algorithm, it is possible to build new points into the 3D-space using the detected points X and the polynomials P (x = f(P1(x1), P2(Y1), P3(X2), P4(Y2))
